        <h2>Yoga Classes</h2>

            <h3><strong>Gentle Hatha Yoga</strong></h3>
        <p>Intended for beginners and anyone wishing a grounded
        foundation in the practice of yoga, this 60 minute class of poses
        and slow movement focuses on asana (proper alignment and posture),
        pranayama (breath work), and guided meditation to foster your mind
            and body connection</p>

            <h3><strong>Vinyasa Yoga</strong></h3>

            <p>Although designed for intermediate to advanced students,
            beginners are welcome to sample this 60 minute class that
            focuses on breath-synchronized movement - you will inhale
                and exhale as you flow energetically through yoga poses</p>



            <h3><strong>Restorative Yoga</strong></h3>

            <p>This 90 minute class features very slow movement and long poses
            that are supported by a chair or wall. This calming, restorative
            experience is suitable for students of any level of experience.
            This practice can be a perfect way to help rehabilitate an
                injury.</p></div>


        <h2>Relax Anytime with Savasna</h2>
        <p>Prepare yourself for savasana. Lie down on your yoga mat with your
        arms at your side with palms up. Close your eyes and breathe slowly but
        deeply. Sink into the mat and let your worries slip away. When you are ready,
        roll on your side and use your arms to push yourself to a sitting position
        with crossed legs. Place your hands in a prayer position. Be grateful for all
        that you have in life. Namaste.</p>
